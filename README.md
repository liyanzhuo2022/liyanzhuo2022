# 👋 Hi there, I'm Yanzhuo Li

I'm a Master's student at Tilburg University, currently pursuing the **Pre-Master in Data Science and Society**, with a strong interest in **backend development**, and **software systems**.

Originally trained in law at **Peking University**, I discovered a passion for building systems through exploring **CS open courses** (like CS50, CS61A/B) and following the amazing self-learning guide https://csdiy.wiki/ — now I'm actively transitioning into software engineering.
